I am a first year PhD student in the [Ries Lab of Butterfly Informatics](https://www.butterflyinformatics.org/) at Georgetown University. My current plan is to focus my research on the effects of an invasive host plant on the fitness and thermal tolerance of a declining wetland butterfly, the Baltimore checkerspot.

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated from UC San Diego with a master's degree in Biology. For my thesis research, I investigated the thermal tolerance of feral and managed honey bees in San Diego in the [lab of James Nieh](https://labs.biology.ucsd.edu/nieh/). 

Before my master's, I graduated from UC San Diego with a bachelor's degree in Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution. Outside of research, I enjoy crocheting and spending time with my two cats.
