Research
======
### Georgetown University - Graduate Student Researcher
#### Advisor: Leslie Ries
Developing research ideas on the effects of larval nutrition on heat tolerance of Baltimore checkerspot butterflies (Euphydryas phaeton). The objective of this project is to assess the impact of invasive host plant use on winter heat tolerance of E. phaeton larvae. Research will include rearing E. phaeton on a native host plant and invasive host plant and exposing larvae to winter heatwaves. RNA-seq will be used to determine differentially expressed genes across treatment groups.

### University of California, San Diego - Graduate Student Researcher
#### Advisor: James Nieh
Investigated the thermal tolerance of feral and managed honey bees (Apis mellifera) in San Diego. The research focused on honey bee survival following exposure to heat shock or cold shock. Results indicated that feral honey bees had greater heat tolerance and cold tolerance in comparison to managed honey bees.

### University of California, San Diego - Undergraduate Student Researcher
#### Advisors: James Nieh, Amy Geffre
Assisted a graduate student in a research project focused on viral infections of feral and managed honey bees (Apis mellifera). The research included viral amplification and monitoring the survival of feral and managed honey bees in laboratory survival trials.
